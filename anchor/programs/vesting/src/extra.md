0. Consider adding additional features:

Treasury funding instruction (to transfer tokens to the treasury)
Vesting schedule modification (if needed)
Admin management (adding/removing authorized creators of vesting schedules)
Treasury Funding Instruction: Consider adding a specific instruction to fund the treasury account, which would make the program more complete. Currently, it's implied that users would transfer tokens to the treasury account externally.
Schedule Modification: You might want to add functionality to modify a schedule (extend the vesting period, increase allocation, etc.) if your use case requires it.
Batch Processing: For efficiency, consider adding batch operations like creating multiple schedules at once or claiming from multiple schedules.
Access Control: Consider implementing more advanced access control patterns if you need multiple admin roles (e.g., a super-admin who can add/remove vesting authorities).
Math Precision: The linear vesting calculation uses integer division which may lead to small rounding errors. If precision is crucial, consider alternative calculation approaches.
